Here are some instructions to compile and run the code locally.

Build
====================

To combine the multiple javascript files in src/* into a single phononwebsite.js file we use rollup.
This pakcage can be installed using npm
```
npm install rollup
```

The phononwebsite.js is built using
```
rollup -c
```

Test
====================
To run the phononwebsite locally you can simply do
```
python -m http.server
```
